### Inspiration
The UNICEF Microsoft Learning Passport  Classroom was inspired by the need to create an inclusive and interactive learning environment that fosters collaboration and engagement among students, especially in underserved communities.

### What it does
The UNICEF Classroom leverages innovative technology, including BLE styluses or air mouse pens and passive LCD paper, to facilitate an interactive flipped classroom experience. It empowers students to learn collaboratively, enhancing engagement and understanding through real-time feedback and personalized learning paths.

### How we built it
We developed the platform using Azure, integrating BLE technology with user-friendly interfaces. Our team collaborated with educators and technologists to design interactive tools that align with active learning methodologies.

### Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges in ensuring seamless connectivity between multiple BLE devices and the app. Additionally, creating an intuitive user experience for both teachers and students required extensive testing and feedback.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are successfully launching a pilot program in several UNICEF Microsoft Learning Passport schools, intending to receiving positive feedback from both students and educators. Our technology should be praised for enhancing student participation and collaboration.

### What we learned
We learned the importance of user feedback in refining our technology. Engaging with educators helped us understand classroom dynamics and adapt our platform to better meet their needs.

### What's next for The UNICEF Classroom
Moving forward, we plan to expand our reach to more schools globally, integrating additional features based on user feedback. We aim to enhance the platform's capabilities to support diverse learning styles and environments.
